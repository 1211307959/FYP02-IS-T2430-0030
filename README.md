# Revenue Prediction System - IDSS for Small Businesses

## Project Overview
A production-ready web-based decision support system that leverages ethical machine learning to provide small businesses with accurate revenue predictions and data-driven insights. The system uses an advanced ethical time-enhanced LightGBM model to analyze historical sales data and generate actionable business recommendations.

**Current Production Model**: Ethical Time-Enhanced LightGBM Model (RÂ² = 0.9937)

**Key Features**:
- **Accurate Revenue Prediction**: 99.37% accuracy using ethical AI without target leakage
- **Interactive Scenario Planning**: Sophisticated price optimization and what-if analysis
- **Sales Forecasting**: Advanced time-series forecasting with confidence intervals
- **Business Insights**: Dynamic recommendations with implementation plans
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Real-time visualizations and KPI monitoring
- **Price Elasticity Modeling**: Economic-based quantity and revenue predictions
- **Temporal Analytics**: Seasonal, holiday, and weekday pattern analysis
- **Location Intelligence**: Multi-location aggregation and comparison

**Target Users**: Small business owners, retail managers, e-commerce operators, data analysts

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**:
- Next.js 14 (React 18)
