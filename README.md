# Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for Small Businesses

![System Architecture](system_architecture.png)

## Project Overview
A web-based decision support system that leverages machine learning to provide small businesses with predictive analytics and data-driven insights. The system analyzes historical sales data to forecast future performance, simulate business scenarios, and generate actionable recommendations.

**Key Features**:
- Sales forecasting with 99.4% accuracy
- Interactive scenario planning
- Automated insights generation
- Visual dashboard with key metrics
- CSV/Excel data integration
- Price optimization recommendations

**Target Users**: Small business owners, retail managers, e-commerce operators
