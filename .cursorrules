# Conversation: Revenue Prediction Model
# Date: 2023-09-06
# Task: Create a production-ready Random Forest model for revenue prediction for small businesses

# Conversation Summary (as of latest update):
#
# 1. Initial Setup and Issues
#    - Started with Random Forest for revenue prediction, Flask API, Next.js frontend.
#    - Early issues: script execution, dependency mismatches, CSS not loading (all resolved).
#
# 2. Model Evolution
#    - Pipeline updated to predict quantity (not require as input), then combined quantity and revenue models.
#    - Tested Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, stacking ensembles.
#    - Feature engineering: price-to-cost ratio, product/customer popularity, seasonality, synthetic price variation for price sensitivity.
#    - Best quantity model (LightGBM, then XGBoost) achieved R² ≈ 0.25; revenue model (using actual quantity) always R² ≈ 1.0.
#
# 3. Data and Feature Changes
