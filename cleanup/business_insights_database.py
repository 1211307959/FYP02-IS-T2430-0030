Business Insights Database - Comprehensive ML-Powered Insights System

This module defines a complete database of business insights that are:
1. 100% data-driven with statistical triggers
2. ML model integrated for predictive insights
3. Dynamically prioritized based on actual business data
4. Scored to show only the most relevant insights
5. Categorized for easy filtering and management

Categories:
- Financial Performance (revenue, profit, cost analysis)
- Product Intelligence (performance, lifecycle, optimization)
- Location Analytics (regional performance, market analysis)
- Pricing Strategy (optimization, elasticity, competition)
- Customer Behavior (segments, patterns, lifetime value)
- Operational Efficiency (inventory, supply chain, processes)
- Risk Management (market risks, performance risks)
- Growth Opportunities (expansion, new products, markets)
- Seasonal Analytics (trends, forecasting, planning)
- Competitive Intelligence (market position, benchmarking)
