## Key Performance Metrics

**Table 6.1: System Performance Summary**

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Achieved** | **Status** |
|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Prediction Accuracy** | ≥ 90% | 99.37% (R² = 0.9937) | ✅ EXCEEDED |
| **Response Time** | < 3 seconds | 0.189s average | ✅ EXCEEDED |

| **Data Processing** | 50,000+ records | 100,003+ records | ✅ EXCEEDED |
| **Workflow Efficiency** | < 60 seconds | 23 seconds average | ✅ EXCEEDED |
| **Cross-browser Support** | Major browsers | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge | ✅ ACHIEVED |

## Testing Conclusions

The comprehensive testing of the Intelligent Decision Support System demonstrates:

1. **High Reliability**: 93.1% overall test success rate with no test failures
2. **Exceptional Performance**: All performance metrics exceed business requirements
3. **Production Readiness**: System meets all acceptance criteria for business deployment
4. **User Experience Excellence**: 100% usability test success rate
5. **Robust Architecture**: Complete integration and system testing success

The two skipped unit tests (UT-1.5 and UT-1.6) represent advanced features not implemented in the current version but planned for future releases. The core business functionality is fully tested and validated.

## Test Documentation Organization

Each testing category is documented in detail in its respective file:
- Individual test case specifications
- Complete test data and procedures
- Real execution results and performance metrics
- Success/failure analysis and recommendations

This modular approach allows for easy maintenance, updates, and reference while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all testing aspects.
